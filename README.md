# Auto EDA Dashboard with Dynamic Visual Insights

This project automates **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using a dynamic, fast, and attractive Python script. 
It supports **any structured dataset** and generates beautiful visualizations tailored to business needs — ready to be shared directly with clients or teams.
Just released: Fully Automated EDA Script for ANY Dataset — Visuals Ready for Clients!

Are you tired of manually plotting charts for every new dataset? I built a dynamic, blazing-fast EDA engine in Python that:

 Automatically adjusts to your dataset  
 Produces stunning neon visuals  
 Saves charts as PNGs ready for business reports  
 Runs at lightning speed (samples intelligently)  
 Skips outliers & keeps it clean

It’s perfect for:
🔹 Business analysts
